    "summary": "Israel threatens retaliatory West Bank annexations as move by UK, Canada and Australia increases tension with US • UK, Canada and Australia announce formal recognition of Palestine, with wave of Israel’s allies to follow The recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada and Australia will set off a global diplomatic scramble as Israel considers retaliatory annexations in the West Bank, a move that would deepen its standoff with Europe, widen its rift with the Arab states, and further distance the US from its allies around the world as the Trump administration maintains support for Netanyahu and Israel in its war in Gaza. Washington had warned allies ahead of Sunday’s announcement that Israel would retaliate “symbolically” and top officials were aware that Israel’s response could imperil cornerstone Trump administration initiatives including the Abraham Accords , which sought to normalise relations between Israel and the Arab states but appear in danger of collapse.

    "summary": "What is motivating the UK’s imminent recognition of Palestine?

For 23 years Marwan Barghouthi has been imprisoned in Israel, having been charged in connection with attacks that killed 26 people, including civilians. He has always proclaimed his innocence and his trial has been strongly criticised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. On the eve of Britain’s recognition of the state of Palestine, Arab Barghouthi and Nosheen Iqbal discuss what statehood means to Palestinians, the difference British recognition will make, and what a viable Palestinian state might look like.
