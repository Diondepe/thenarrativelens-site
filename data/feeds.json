    "summary": "Chancellor cites the UK’s exit from EU alongside austerity and Truss’s mini-budget as issues affecting economy In his Sky News interview with the chancellor, Sam Coates put it to her that the UK was in a “doom loop” where the government needed to come back every year with higher taxes to fill a black hole in the public finances. Rachel Reeves replied: “Nobody wants that cycle to end more than I do, Sam.” But, when Coates asked her if she could rule out having to put taxes up again in 2026, Reeves just avoided the question, telling him: Our economy is doing well. I recognise that the cost of living challenges are still very real for people. In the last parliament, living standards fell. That’s the first time that’s ever happened. Living standards are rising today because of the increases in the national living wage, the national minimum wage, and because inflation and interest rates are lower than they were under the previous government. Is there more to do? Absolutely, but I will never take risks through the public finances because when you do, it is ordinary people that pay the price. Last year Rachel Reeves raised taxes by £40 billion. She said she wouldn’t come back for more. Now the Chancellor has confirmed she’s about to break her promise. Rachel Reeves doesn’t need to raise taxes. She needs to get a grip of government spending - including the welfare bill. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Labour says Tory government at time failed to classify China as a threat, but plenty of evidence suggests the contrary There is a baffling contradiction at the heart of the efforts of Dan Jarvis, the security minister, to explain why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for China collapsed last month. The problem, he insisted in front of MPs on Monday, was that “it was not the policy of a Conservative government to classify China as a threat to national security”. Except there is plenty of evidence to suggest that China was recognised as a threat by the previous governments in documents and public statements by ministers and officials. All this makes the failure of the government witness – Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser – to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising.

Trump briefly shook the prime minister’s hand and called him “his friend”, before turning his back on him and continuing to explain how he had brought peace to the Middle East without allowing the prime minister to say a word.
