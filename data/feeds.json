Nonetheless, one thing is abundantly clear: this is a party thinking big. That might sound anomalous when we are perhaps three years from an election and the Lib Dems already have 72 MPs, the biggest contingent in a century .

As the new home secretary she will be in charge of migration – one of the country’s most divisive issues. So who is she and what does she believe in? The Guardian’s senior political correspondent, Peter Walker , tells Lucy Hough about Mahmood’s upbringing in Birmingham and her decision to become an MP at the age of 29.
