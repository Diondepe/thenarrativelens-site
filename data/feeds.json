    "summary": "Questions mount over collapse of trial of teacher and parliamentary researcher accused of spying for China. Dan Sabbagh reports It had all the makings of a pulpy political thriller. For years, British intelligence had been warning about the growing threat of Chinese influence, from political interference to suspected espionage.
