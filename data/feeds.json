Fracking is and always has been unpopular, both with people facing it off locally and the wider public. The government must now translate its plans to ban fracking permanently into policy, alongside closing a loophole in planning law that still allows it to happen by the backdoor.

    "summary": "The Labour leader entered conference with the polls against him and Reform UK snapping at his heels. He came out fighting – but was it enough to change his critics’ minds? Helen Pidd For Keir Starmer, this year’s Labour conference was a chance not just to address the party faithful but to see if there were any faithful left. With terrible approval ratings, and Reform UK in the ascendant, it was hard to see who his supporters might be, while Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, seemed to be getting ready to challenge him as leader. On the left of the party there were calls not just for another ‘reset’ but for a wholesale change of direction. Helen Pidd spoke to delegates and MPs who told her that, even if they liked the prime minister, they were worried he was not able to communicate with the public – while the right of the party wanted Starmer to show voters Reform were not the people to turn to.

With the historic Liver Building behind him, he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “At the end of it people can agree or disagree, but they can’t say they don’t know what we stand for, what this government is trying to achieve.” Continue reading...",
