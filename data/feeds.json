Five years after the UK quit the bloc, more than a third reported feeling discriminated against by public bodies. One in five said they had experienced difficulties accessing their rights including the right to work, the right to travel in and out of the country and their right to equal treatment in public services.

    "summary": "There is not currently a permanent ban in law, just a temporary moratorium Some people have argued that it is a mistake for Keir Starmer and Labour to talk about Nigel Farage and Reform UK as much as they have. There is a case for saying that this just shores up the credibility of a party with only five MPs, and it switches the news agenda towards immigration and small boats (issues where Reform UK polls well) and away from “Labour issues” like health. And art of this argument is that, by calling the Reform UK migration policy racist, Labour is also making it easier for Farage to leverage grievance (which, as Starmer himself argued in his speech yesterday, is part of what lies behind Reform UK’s electoral support. I think it’s a mistake to pretend this isn’t the fight of our times. If it is the fight of our times, we’ve got to recognise that, and we’ve got to be in it. I think simply ignoring it is a mistake, a political mistake. No, not at all. There is a political fight that has to be had, and it’s about the future of our country. This is a different fight to the traditional Labour/Conservative fight. You can see versions of this going on in many other countries across Europe. I think that if Reform were to gain power, they would tear our country apart and fundamentally change us as a country. We have seen the most extraordinary 48 hours of demonisation, and I’m going to say it again, incitement to violence against the man who is the bookmakers’ favourite to be the next prime minister.

    "summary": "PM says Reform’s migration plan makes it ‘enemy of national renewal’, while Farage accuses Labour of endangering his party’s politicians and activists with its language. This live blog is closed Wes Streeting , the health secretary, has said that Tony Blair could play a positive role in Gaza helping to lead the administration there proposed under Donald Trump’s peace plan. In an interview on LBC, Streeting said that Blair’s decision to involve the UK in the Iraq war was “a catastrophic error” that had “devasting consequences”. He said that he personally opposed it at the time. I also think about Tony Blair’s other legacy, great legacy, which is Northern Ireland, and there he showed that he could bring together sworn enemies to broker a lasting peace. So if Tony Blair can put those skills to use, if he’s got the confidence of both the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the regional players, as seems to be the case, then great.

    "summary": "Exclusive: Officials exploring options to change rule that affected 1.7 million children in Great Britain last year Rachel Reeves is to lift the two-child benefit limit in the budget, a key demand of Labour MPs and child poverty campaigners, with officials exploring options of a tapered system instead. The chancellor and Keir Starmer have said they expect to respond to recommendations of the child poverty taskforce at the budget, which is expected to say that lifting the two-child limit for universal credit and child tax credit would be one of the most effective ways to lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.
