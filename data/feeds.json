    "summary": "Use by Nigel Farage is latest example of terms coined by the ‘extremely online right’ entering political mainstream This article is an extract from our First Edition newsletter. Sign up here At a policy launch on Monday that would have been considered extreme just a few years ago, Nigel Farage said a Reform UK government would not just abolish indefinite leave to remain for those arriving in the UK , but rescind the status of those who had already been granted it, and force them to apply for new visas. He said the policy was necessary for one reason above all: “to wake everybody up to the Boriswave”. You might have noticed that term in the past few months: it has been used repeatedly in the mainstream media to describe the sharp increase in inward migration from outside the EU after Brexit, when Boris Johnson was prime minister.

    "summary": "Shabana Mahmood is already making headlines in her new role. But who is she and what motivates her? Shabana Mahmood is now the first Muslim woman in one of the great offices of state. As the new home secretary she will be in charge of migration – one of the country’s most divisive issues. So who is she and what does she believe in? The Guardian’s senior political correspondent, Peter Walker , tells Lucy Hough about Mahmood’s upbringing in Birmingham and her decision to become an MP at the age of 29. Being given the safe seat of Birmingham Ladywood, says Peter, was a sign that she was “who Labour bigwigs expected to be in parliament for a long time and would have hopes that they do something good with it”.
