The force posted on X saying police were called to the synagogue, on Middleton Road, Crumpsall, at 9.31am by a member of the public , stating he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and one man had been stabbed. Police said four people have suffered injuries caused by a vehicle and stabbings at a synagogue in Crumpsall , north Manchester . A cordon has been set up after the incident , and a major road had been closed while officers attended. Paramedics are at the scene. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, said the “immediate danger appears to be over” after reports of a “serious incident”. Burnham has told BBC Radio Manchester that “it is believed” that the attacker is dead. However, he says this “is not confirmed” yet. Sources say it is being treated as a potential terrorist incident. Counter-terrorism police and MI5, the security service covering the UK, have joined the investigation. Greater Manchester police say Operation Plato was declared, meaning the violence was treated as a potential marauding terrorist attack. The attack was branded an “appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year” by the Community Security Trust (CST). CST is working with police and the local Jewish community following a serious incident at a synagogue in north Manchester. This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year. Continue reading...",

The Greens are least trusted on the economy and on defence. But there is something remarkable about this. In his write-up for YouGov , Dylan Difford says: Unsurprisingly, Britons have a particular degree of confidence in the Greens when it comes to the environment. What’s notable, though, is that a majority of Britons (54%) say they have at least a fair amount of trust in the party on the issue. Out of the 18 areas polled, which have been asked about all five major parties, this is the only issue for any of the parties for where most people express confidence in a given party.

Sources at Farage’s Reform UK party responded by calling the comment “disgusting and libellous”.
