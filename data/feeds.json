A medical abortion involves taking two medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, to end a pregnancy. In 2022, at-home medical abortions were made permanent in England and Wales, after temporary legislation allowed them to take place at home during the pandemic. In Northern Ireland, at-home abortion care is not permitted at any gestation. Continue reading...",

The force posted on X saying police were called to the synagogue, on Middleton Road, Crumpsall, at 9.31am by a member of the public , stating he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and one man had been stabbed. Police said four people have suffered injuries caused by a vehicle and stabbings at a synagogue in Crumpsall , north Manchester . A cordon has been set up after the incident , and a major road had been closed while officers attended. Paramedics are at the scene. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, said the “immediate danger appears to be over” after reports of a “serious incident”. Burnham has told BBC Radio Manchester that “it is believed” that the attacker is dead. However, he says this “is not confirmed” yet. Sources say it is being treated as a potential terrorist incident. Counter-terrorism police and MI5, the security service covering the UK, have joined the investigation. Greater Manchester police say Operation Plato was declared, meaning the violence was treated as a potential marauding terrorist attack. The attack was branded an “appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year” by the Community Security Trust (CST). CST is working with police and the local Jewish community following a serious incident at a synagogue in north Manchester. This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year. Continue reading...",
