    "summary": "Silverpit crater off Yorkshire coast was caused by cathedral-sized asteroid that set off 100-metre tsunami 43m years ago Deep below the seabed, 80 miles off the coast of Yorkshire, is a remarkable crater that has divided scientists – was it, thrillingly, created by an asteroid crash? Or more mundanely was it the result of geological salt movements? Today, the decades-long scientific debate can be settled. The Silverpit crater 700 metres below the seabed under the North Sea was in all likelihood created by a direct hit from an asteroid or comet about the size of York Minster that hurtled towards the Earth more than 43m years ago.

A long-awaited trial of two men – a former parliamentary aide to Kearns, Christopher Cash, and an associate, Christopher Berry – accused of spying for China was to be abandoned . “The cops were equally disappointed,” Kearns told the Guardian. The trial had been expected to be an extraordinary test of London’s already fraught relationship with Beijing. Scheduled to begin at Woolwich crown court on 6 October, it had been expected to hear allegations that “politically sensitive” information was passing from Westminster to a member of China’s ruling politburo.

And the recognition is the first step towards changing that, and I really welcome that step.’ Arab Barghouthi advocates on behalf of his father, Marwan, a Palestinian political leader commonly referred to as ‘Palestine’s Mandela’. For 23 years Marwan Barghouthi has been imprisoned in Israel, having been charged in connection with attacks that killed 26 people, including civilians. He has always proclaimed his innocence and his trial has been strongly criticised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. On the eve of Britain’s recognition of the state of Palestine, Arab Barghouthi and Nosheen Iqbal discuss what statehood means to Palestinians, the difference British recognition will make, and what a viable Palestinian state might look like.
