    "summary": "Reform UK deputy leader says tax cut plans no longer a ‘commitment’ but an ‘aspiration’ Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor. Kate Forbes , Scotland’s outgoing deputy first minister, has repeated the Scottish National party’s call for a cut in the energy windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas, in an address to the party’s annual conference. In a classic move by this Labour government, they accept the 78% tax rate is costing jobs – but they won’t do anything about it for another five years. So we call on the chancellor today – don’t wait, replace the destructive fiscal regime at the next budget with a fair one. One that protects workers and enables the energy transition. We are leading the world in the innovation, technology and commercialisation of renewable energy. That is why it is so bewildering that the UK government would rather focus on the distraction of new nuclear, rather than on Scotland’s renewable potential. I share the deep feeling of relief as Avinatan Or and other hostages are released today. But this is also a stark reminder of the treatment that he has been subject to at the hands of Hamas, and the atrocities that shook the world two years ago. Having met his family, I know that no one can truly understand the torture and agony they suffered for two drawn out years and my thoughts are with them. My thoughts are also with the family of Yossi Sharabi, who are still waiting for news. Continue reading...",
