    "title": "Muddle over semantics or pressure from China? Collapsed spying case remains baffling",
    "summary": "Labour says Tory government at time failed to classify China as a threat, but plenty of evidence suggests the contrary There is a baffling contradiction at the heart of the efforts of Dan Jarvis, the security minister, to explain why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for China collapsed last month. The problem, he insisted in front of MPs on Monday, was that “it was not the policy of a Conservative government to classify China as a threat to national security”. Except there is plenty of evidence to suggest that China was recognised as a threat by the previous governments in documents and public statements by ministers and officials. All this makes the failure of the government witness – Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser – to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising.

    "summary": "While some question UK’s ‘key’ role in negotiations, others claim British influence was significant For British officials who had spent the last 24 hours talking up the UK’s role in negotiating peace in Gaza, Monday’s press conference by Donald Trump in Egypt was a brutal lesson in realpolitik. “Where’s the United Kingdom?” asked the US president before ushering up Keir Starmer, who had been stood behind him. Trump briefly shook the prime minister’s hand and called him “his friend”, before turning his back on him and continuing to explain how he had brought peace to the Middle East without allowing the prime minister to say a word.
