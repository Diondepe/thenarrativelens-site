He will be flying to Chequers by helicopter. Volodymyr Zelenskyy , the Ukrainian president, has thanked King Charles for what he said at the state banquet last night strongly supporting the Ukrainian cause.

Together, we have achieved a lot, and with the support of freedom-loving nations—the UK, our European partners, and the US—we continue to defend values and protect lives. We are united in our efforts to make diplomacy work and secure lasting peace for the European continent. Our countries have the closest defence, security and intelligence relationship ever known. In two world wars, we fought together to defeat the forces of tyranny. Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace.

    "summary": "Holding borrowing rates and continuing bond sell-offs were widely expected but an alternative was available “Gradual” and “predictable” are the watchwords at the Bank of England.
