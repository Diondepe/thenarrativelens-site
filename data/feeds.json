Speaking on GB News, Mahmood said: As far as I am concerned, I would have wanted to see people in this country step back from protesting for at least a few days, just to give the Jewish community here a chance to process what has happened and to begin the grieving process as well. I am very disappointed that some of the organisers haven’t heeded the call to step back. In terms of the attacker, this individual was not known to the security services. He has obviously been shot dead at the scene, but the police investigations will now continue at pace. Continue reading...",

Jihad al-Shamie, 35, was being investigated over an alleged sexual attack which it is understood was said to have taken place earlier this year. Greater Manchester police said it appeared that armed officers at the synagogue accidentally shot one of the two victims killed during the terrorist attack and that they probably injured another after opening fire on the attacker. Sources disclosed that counter-terrorism police were examining whether Shamie was responsible for a death threat sent to a former Conservative MP in 2012. Keir Starmer called for people to “respect the grief of British Jews” after activists planning to demonstrate against the ban on Palestine Action on Saturday said cancelling the event would “let terror win”. David Lammy, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, was heckled and booed as he addressed a vigil close to the scene of the attack. He faced calls of “shame on you”, “go to Palestine, leave us alone” and “you have blood on your hands”. Police named the two dead men as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Relatives of Cravitz said he was a “gentle giant” who “would never harm a fly”. A Muslim neighbour of Daulby described him as “one of the most fantastic men I ever knew in my life”. Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading a service at the synagogue at the time of the attack, told how the attacker shouted “I’m going to get you” as he tried to force his way in. Continue reading...",
