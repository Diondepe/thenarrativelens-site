    "summary": "Shadow energy secretary’s plans dismissed as ‘dead wrong’ by environment groups Mel Stride , the shadow chancellor, was doing an interview round for the Conservatives this morning, and Miatta Fahnbulleh , the faith and communities minister, was on the air on behalf of the government. They were both asked about the latest development in the flag phenomenon – the former footballer turned property developer Gary Neville saying that he took down a union flag flying at one of his building sites because he felt it was being used in a “negative fashion”. Asked if Neville (a Labour supporter) had a point, Fahnbulleh told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: I think he’s really right, that there are people who are trying to divide us at the moment … I spent a lot of time going around our communities, talking to people.

And you will get people trying to stoke division, trying to blame others, trying to stoke tension. I think people that put up flags, the vast majority of people that do, do so for perfectly reasonable patriotic reasons.
