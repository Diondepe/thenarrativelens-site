    "title": "Reform branded ‘threat to democracy’ over Farage plan to remove thousands of migrants with leave to be in UK – politics live",
    "summary": "Nigel Farage says Reform UK would scrap the main route that migrants take to gain British citizenship Sunder Katwala , director of the British Future thinktank, which focuses on migration, race and identify, has posted a threat on Bluesky which raises questions he hopes Nigel Farage addresses at this press conference. Katwala says: Have Reform been asked if forcing all foreign nationals with settled status to apply for a new temporary status really does mean renewing on & tearing up the UK/EU citizens agreements after Brexit? I would exoect/hope they would quickly exempt EU settled status from this It is clearly a conscious decision to strip those with settled status and indefinite leave to remain of it. That is reprehensible in principle (and leaves the door open to applying this to citizens too) while changing the settlement rules for those here with temporary status can be “future policy” Challenging this for EU nationals, non-EU nationals and refugees is right The EU settled status point is a direct breach of commitments, which Farage supported, and which is reprehensible to Europeans in Britain, with dangers for UK citizens in EU from reneging on the commitments to respect rights Applying it to EU nationals will be unpopular with public - most Leave voters - because as an 84% consensus for “apply new rules to future arrivals, give the right to settle to those already here” so enacting that by 2020 before threatening to rip it up in 2029 is so obviously unfair & dishonourable The 84% support (90% remain + 77% leave) was reflected in my coalition of unusual allies - vote leave, migration watch, ukip, toby young + cbi, tuc, universities, migrants groups - a week after the 2016 referendum on the principle of letting those here stay & settle www.britishfuture.org/15131/ The online right is pressing rightwing politiciand to significant and extreme over-reach in advocating remigration & repatriation policies. This excites the racists who want to go for naturalised citizens & UK-born minorities. Damaging if the mainstream does not challenge the overreach, Mainstream are hamstrung on 2019-24 arrivals Cons want to atone for tripling net migration by now adopting send them back language to those they invited in Continue reading...",
