    "summary": "Prices have risen by 34% since 2022, with 29% of psychologists refusing new patients The cost of seeing private psychologists is soaring and many are so busy they are turning away new clients, research has found. The prices psychologists charge have risen by 34% since 2022 and 12 sessions now cost an average of £1,550, compared with £1,152 just three years ago, according to a survey by myTribe Insurance, which tracks the cost of private medical care. The average cost of a consultation in the UK has risen from £96 in 2022 to £129.20 in 2025. Psychologists in England charge the most (£131) per session and those in Scotland the least (£124). Those in Scotland have the shortest waiting times (16.9 days), and people in Wales the longest (23.8 days). While London clinics charge the most for a consultation – £160 on average – fees at those in the north-east of England are much lower (£107). Continue reading...",

The home secretary’s comments cast aspersions on the 25-year-old Eritrean in the individual case and asylum seekers more widely.

When tyranny threatens Europe once again, we must all hold firm, and Britain continues to lead in defending freedom on many fronts. Together, we have achieved a lot, and with the support of freedom-loving nations—the UK, our European partners, and the US—we continue to defend values and protect lives. We are united in our efforts to make diplomacy work and secure lasting peace for the European continent. Our countries have the closest defence, security and intelligence relationship ever known. In two world wars, we fought together to defeat the forces of tyranny. Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace.
