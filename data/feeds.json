On Saturday, education secretary, said that 500,000 more children across England will soon benefit from the government’s role out of free breakfast clubs The start of the national rollout of free breakfast clubs will be an historic change in working families’ daily routines and is another example of this Labour government making good on its promises to deliver the change the British people voted for. This is Labour choosing a path of renewal towards a fairer country – breaking down the barriers to opportunity and ensuring every child starts school ready to learn. I have worked hard as a councillor for Langside for the past three years to build a better community and now I can’t wait to be the voice of change across our great communities in the constituency. As your candidate for Glasgow Southside, I will always put people and planet before corporate greed, I will fight back against the millionaires who are pushing racist anti-migrant narratives and I will call out the horrific genocide in Gaza. Since then, she’s been a great voice for the local community and I have no doubt that she’ll be a fantastic candidate for the constituency. Green support in Glasgow Southside has been growing steadily in recent years and we’re looking forward to the campaign for Holyrood, in Southside, across Glasgow and throughout the country.
