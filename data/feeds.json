Washington had warned allies ahead of Sunday’s announcement that Israel would retaliate “symbolically” and top officials were aware that Israel’s response could imperil cornerstone Trump administration initiatives including the Abraham Accords , which sought to normalise relations between Israel and the Arab states but appear in danger of collapse.

    "summary": "What is motivating the UK’s imminent recognition of Palestine? With Arab Barghouthi and Patrick Wintour ‘I remember the stories of the resistance fighters that went against the British army back then … even if that’s the history, even if that is their legacy in British politics, it’s never too late to change it.

For 23 years Marwan Barghouthi has been imprisoned in Israel, having been charged in connection with attacks that killed 26 people, including civilians.
