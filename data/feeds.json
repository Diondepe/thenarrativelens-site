An earlier version said: “For a while the cap was so high it was impossible for providers to offer deals below it.” In fact, that should have said that wholesale energy prices were so high that it was impossible for providers to offer deals below the cap.

    "summary": "The Labour leader entered conference with the polls against him and Reform UK snapping at his heels. He came out fighting – but was it enough to change his critics’ minds? Helen Pidd For Keir Starmer, this year’s Labour conference was a chance not just to address the party faithful but to see if there were any faithful left. With terrible approval ratings, and Reform UK in the ascendant, it was hard to see who his supporters might be, while Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, seemed to be getting ready to challenge him as leader. On the left of the party there were calls not just for another ‘reset’ but for a wholesale change of direction. Helen Pidd spoke to delegates and MPs who told her that, even if they liked the prime minister, they were worried he was not able to communicate with the public – while the right of the party wanted Starmer to show voters Reform were not the people to turn to.

    "summary": "Prime minister answers his critics in conference speech but the real challenges still lie ahead When Keir Starmer sat in the chair for his broadcast interview at the start of the Labour conference on Sunday, he already had a clear idea of what he wanted to pull off during the four-day political gathering in Liverpool. With the historic Liver Building behind him, he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “At the end of it people can agree or disagree, but they can’t say they don’t know what we stand for, what this government is trying to achieve.” Continue reading...",
