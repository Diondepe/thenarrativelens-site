    "title": "‘Don’t pay any attention to what Trump says about medicine’, Wes Streeting tells Britons – UK politics live",
    "summary": "Medical experts concerned alarms after US president warned pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol in move contradicted by research According to a story by Patrick Maguire in the Times, a key Labour thinktank is also floating the idea – backed by the Liberal Democrats (see 11.24am ) – that asylum seekers should be allowed to work while their claims are being processed. Maguire says a paper from Labour Together (the Morgan McSweeney outfit – see 9.45am ) is circulating a paper in government called The Case of Contribution. Keir Starmer has always had difficulty setting out a personal, political philosophy, and many of his critics argue that this is a problem because, they say, his non-ideological managerialism has not been very inspiring. Boldest of the lot are the proposals on migration, which, if taken up even in part, would represent the biggest paradigm shift of all. Reform UK has set the agenda with proposals to deny benefits to even legal migrants. By the standards of the centre-left, Labour Together’s suggestion is just as radical. Rather than leave Isak, an Eritrean with post-traumatic stress disorder, languishing in an asylum hotel , their paper proposes he be granted time-limited refugee status for six months. He signs a contract that obliges him to learn English, find work and private accommodation; his access to any income support via universal credit is strictly conditional on him fulfilling its terms. Of all the changes suggested, this one – given that asylum seekers cannot currently work legally – would have the most profound consequences for British politics and the economy. Why an asylum-seeker is drawn to Britain over, say, France is not obvious. A 2016 report from Warwick University, based on findings from 29 separate studies into asylum-seeker motives, concluded that social networks and shared languages were crucial. The report could not find a single study showing a significant correlation between work rights and destination choice. If asylum-seekers in Calais were motivated by working rights those who had yet to apply would stay in France, where they could work sooner. End the use of asylum hotels by speeding up application processing so thousands aren’t stuck in limbo and those with valid claims can work, integrate and contribute, while those without a right to remain can be returned swiftly. Lift the ban on employment for asylum seekers who’ve waited over three months for a decision. Continue reading...",

He said the policy was necessary for one reason above all: “to wake everybody up to the Boriswave”. You might have noticed that term in the past few months: it has been used repeatedly in the mainstream media to describe the sharp increase in inward migration from outside the EU after Brexit, when Boris Johnson was prime minister.
