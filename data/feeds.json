The key question on which the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report , in 2022, reached hard-won scientific consensus was when CO 2 emissions need to peak for a realistic chance of keeping global temperature increases below 1.5C, the target set by the 2015 Paris agreement as too dangerous to exceed.
