    "summary": "Questions mount over collapse of trial of teacher and parliamentary researcher accused of spying for China. Dan Sabbagh reports It had all the makings of a pulpy political thriller. For years, British intelligence had been warning about the growing threat of Chinese influence, from political interference to suspected espionage. Then in 2023, two young British men – a parliamentary researcher and a teacher in China – were arrested and accused of spying for China. The headlines were dramatic. But days before the trial was due to begin, the entire case collapsed. Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, was shocked. “I was absolutely gobsmacked,” he tells Nosheen Iqbal.

Without overdoing the blame, say many experts, the chancellor’s tough budget last year and the likelihood of a repeat next month hangs over employers and how they recruit and pay staff. The latest official figures show a rising number of young people out of work in the three months to August. More broadly, unemployment rose to a four-year high and the number of vacancies fell. And then there was the stubborn increase in the public sector wage bill, which outpaced the much more modest increase in private sector wages. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Labour says Tory government at time failed to classify China as a threat, but plenty of evidence suggests the contrary There is a baffling contradiction at the heart of the efforts of Dan Jarvis, the security minister, to explain why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for China collapsed last month. The problem, he insisted in front of MPs on Monday, was that “it was not the policy of a Conservative government to classify China as a threat to national security”. Except there is plenty of evidence to suggest that China was recognised as a threat by the previous governments in documents and public statements by ministers and officials. All this makes the failure of the government witness – Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser – to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising.
