    "summary": "Housing secretary makes comments after Labour MPs reportedly lobby Burnham to challenge Starmer for leadership; Manchester mayor discusses policy ideas in Telegraph and New Statesmen interviews In his New Statesman interview published yesterday Andy Burnham , the mayor of Greater Manchester, set out some of the policy ideas he thought the government should be adopting. Here are some more that he floated in his Telegraph interview. Council tax rebanding, so that people living in the largest homes pay more. There is widespread agreement that the current system is overly-generous to people living in the most valuable homes, because they pay much less council tax as a share of the property’s value. Burnham said there was a “huge underpayment of tax that should now be corrected”. He explained: If you look at London, I think there are people in homes that are even in double-figure millions paying less council tax than people [in Manchester]. It’s just not justifiable … where something is like that, it needs fixing. Reintroducing the 50p top rate of income tax. Burnham said there was “definitely a case” for this. And tax cuts for lower earners. Burnham said higher taxes for top earners should be combined with cuts for poorer people. He said: I would urge the chancellor to consider a tax change at the other end. The 10p tax, I think, was actually one of the really innovative and quite interesting things that the Labour government did. More focus on technical education, based on the “Greater Manchester baccalaureate” scheme he has initiated. Continue reading...",

Nonetheless, one thing is abundantly clear: this is a party thinking big. That might sound anomalous when we are perhaps three years from an election and the Lib Dems already have 72 MPs, the biggest contingent in a century . But in a political era almost unparalleled in flux, there is an argument they are responding to the chaos as effectively as anyone. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Use by Nigel Farage is latest example of terms coined by the ‘extremely online right’ entering political mainstream This article is an extract from our First Edition newsletter. Sign up here At a policy launch on Monday that would have been considered extreme just a few years ago, Nigel Farage said a Reform UK government would not just abolish indefinite leave to remain for those arriving in the UK , but rescind the status of those who had already been granted it, and force them to apply for new visas. He said the policy was necessary for one reason above all: “to wake everybody up to the Boriswave”. You might have noticed that term in the past few months: it has been used repeatedly in the mainstream media to describe the sharp increase in inward migration from outside the EU after Brexit, when Boris Johnson was prime minister. But “Boriswave” is not simply a pithy description of a sociological phenomenon but a term coined and popularised among the online far right. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Shabana Mahmood is already making headlines in her new role. But who is she and what motivates her? Shabana Mahmood is now the first Muslim woman in one of the great offices of state. As the new home secretary she will be in charge of migration – one of the country’s most divisive issues. So who is she and what does she believe in? The Guardian’s senior political correspondent, Peter Walker , tells Lucy Hough about Mahmood’s upbringing in Birmingham and her decision to become an MP at the age of 29. Being given the safe seat of Birmingham Ladywood, says Peter, was a sign that she was “who Labour bigwigs expected to be in parliament for a long time and would have hopes that they do something good with it”. Part of the Blue Labour movement, she retreated to the backbenches during the Corbyn era – only to return when Starmer took control of the Labour party. Continue reading...",
