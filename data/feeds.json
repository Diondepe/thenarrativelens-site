    "summary": "Party leader also addresses immigration and sets out what she says are the achievements of 14 years of Tory rule in closing speech at Manchester Voting in the Labour deputy leadership election opens today. Lucy Powell , the former Commons leader, is seen as the favourite and, as Jessica Elgot reports, Powell told supporters yesterday that, if she is elected, she will use the post to argue for changes in the way the government is operating. “We can’t sugarcoat the fact that things aren’t going well,” she said. Powell is no longer a government minister and, if she is elected deputy leader, she will do the job from the backbenches. In an interview on Newsnight last night, Bridget Phillipson , the education secretary standing against Powell, said a Powell victory would be “destabilising” for the party. She said: [Electing Powell] risks destabilising the party … we best achieve what we need to do together when we have those fierce conversations, including disagreements, behind closed doors. Members need to understand that there’s a potential challenge around all of that – that if you’re not inside when the big decisions are being made, you’re not at that table, you’re not in those conversations.
