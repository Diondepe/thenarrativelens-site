    "summary": "Prosecutor hinted at lack of backing from Downing Street but legal experts argue prosecution was still possible An extraordinary disclosure by Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, on Tuesday evening has triggered a political row over who was behind the sudden abandonment of a high-profile espionage case.
