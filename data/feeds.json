And the recognition is the first step towards changing that, and I really welcome that step.’ Arab Barghouthi advocates on behalf of his father, Marwan, a Palestinian political leader commonly referred to as ‘Palestine’s Mandela’. For 23 years Marwan Barghouthi has been imprisoned in Israel, having been charged in connection with attacks that killed 26 people, including civilians. He has always proclaimed his innocence and his trial has been strongly criticised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. On the eve of Britain’s recognition of the state of Palestine, Arab Barghouthi and Nosheen Iqbal discuss what statehood means to Palestinians, the difference British recognition will make, and what a viable Palestinian state might look like.
