    "summary": "Ex-DPP Ken Macdonald says prosecutors may have been ‘over-fussy’ in seeking further assurances from government Legal experts have questioned the explanation given by the Crown Prosecution Service for its sudden decision to drop charges against two Britons accused of spying for China amid a political row over who was responsible.
