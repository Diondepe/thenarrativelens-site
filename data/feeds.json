    "summary": "Use by Nigel Farage is latest example of terms coined by the ‘extremely online right’ entering political mainstream This article is an extract from our First Edition newsletter. Sign up here At a policy launch on Monday that would have been considered extreme just a few years ago, Nigel Farage said a Reform UK government would not just abolish indefinite leave to remain for those arriving in the UK , but rescind the status of those who had already been granted it, and force them to apply for new visas. He said the policy was necessary for one reason above all: “to wake everybody up to the Boriswave”. You might have noticed that term in the past few months: it has been used repeatedly in the mainstream media to describe the sharp increase in inward migration from outside the EU after Brexit, when Boris Johnson was prime minister. But “Boriswave” is not simply a pithy description of a sociological phenomenon but a term coined and popularised among the online far right. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Medical experts concerned alarms after US president warned pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol in move contradicted by research Wes Streeting , the health secretary, has urged pregnant women to ignore Donald Trump’s claims about a link between taking paracetamol and autism. Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine, Streeting said: I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this. I’ve just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None. In fact, a major study was done back in 2024 in Sweden, involving 2.4 million children, and it did not uphold those claims. Between January and April 2020, Labour held a leadership contest. Evidence from that period suggests that the prime minister accepted potentially thousands of pounds’ worth of advice and polling via the members’ association Labour Together. A review of his register of members’ interests for that time reveals no record of these donations. The parliamentary rules are clear that “support in kind” from Labour Together should have been declared, but it was not. In 2021, the Electoral Commission fined Labour Together for failing to report donations covering the period 2017 to 2020. New evidence has since come to light which raises questions as to whether this failure was deliberate, in an attempt to mislead the Electoral Commission. At the time, the prime minister’s now Chief of Staff, Morgan McSweeney, was a director at Labour Together and responsible for legal compliance. Neither Keir, nor his leadership campaign accepted monetary or in kind donations from Labour Together during the leadership election. Continue reading...",
