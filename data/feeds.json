    "summary": "PM calls Reform’s policy immoral but says people who want to vote for them are not racist but frustrated Kuenssberg ended her interview by asking about Andy Burnham, and the leadership. Starmer said Burnham was doing a very good job as mayor of Greater Manchester. Comments about leaders and leadership are part and parcel of being in politics. It is the bread and butter of politics, every leader get its, it always comes up, particularly at conference. It’s in the job description. People are entitled to their views and I’m not sticking my fingers in my ear in the slightest. What I am saying is that it is important to keep focusing on what it is that we are delivering, and saying, absolutely in clear terms, the difference it makes to people’s lives. One, have we improved living standards? Do people genuinly feel better off? Two, have we improved public services? Is the NHS in a better place, and people can feel it. And, three, do people feel safe and secure in their home, in their neighbourhood, and that their country is secure. It’s a five-year mandate, and I will be judged at the end of that five years, and quite right too. I just need the space and get on and do what we need to do, and do those three things above all else. I am saying we have got the fight of our lives ahead of us because we’ve got to take on Reform and we’ve got to beat them. So now is not the time for introspection or navel-gazing. There is a fight that we are all in together, and every single member of our party and our movement – actually, everyone who cares about what this country is, whether they vote Labour or otherwise - it’s the fight of our lives for who we are as a country. We need to be in that fight, united not navel-gazing. I’m absolutely clear in my mind about that, and that’s what I will be talking about at conference. Sir Keir Starmer gave land to his parents via a trust that meant their estates would never pay inheritance tax on the asset whatever its eventual value, according to legal experts. The prime minister’s decision to place a seven-acre field within the structure meant its value was excluded from his parents’ estate, of which he was a beneficiary, when they died.

The Democracy in Danger report by the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption found the UK government was in breach of eight different international standards on ensuring the independence of electoral bodies by maintaining the government’s oversight of the watchdog. The UK government is in breach of eight different international standards on ensuring the independence of electoral bodies by maintaining the new power in place. All the constitutional oversight bodies that reviewed the ministerial power opposed its introduction – including two parliamentary committees, the UK’s top ethics body, the Committee on Standards in Public Life, and the Electoral Commission’s oversight body, the Speaker’s Committee. The UK has plummeted down international rankings for electoral body autonomy since the power was introduced and now ranks 44th, among countries such as Ghana, Nepal and Croatia. It has fallen out of line with comparable countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. The power, which was described by the former MI5 director general and former chair of the committee on standards in public life, Jonathan Evans, as “giving a toddler a gun”, could be used by a future government with autocratic tendencies to distort electoral rules in its favour to maintain power.
