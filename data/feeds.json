But in the past week recriminations have swirled after the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for China was dropped . A refusal by the government to describe China as a national security threat has reinforced Labour’s already softened approach to Beijing and sharpened focus on the figure at its heart: Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell.
