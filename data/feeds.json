    "summary": "Environmental groups have welcomed the energy secretary’s fracking announcement At the Labour conference Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has just started his speech. Responding to the news that he will announce a total ban on fracking (see 9.19am ), Asad Rehman, chief executive of Friends of the Earth , said: By providing a clear vision for our energy future based on helping people, not on ignoring the science, the energy secretary has sent an important message that the government is listening to communities. Fracking is and always has been unpopular, both with people facing it off locally and the wider public. The government must now translate its plans to ban fracking permanently into policy, alongside closing a loophole in planning law that still allows it to happen by the backdoor. Andy Burnham is doing a fantastic job as the mayor of Manchester. I actually worked closely with him.

    "summary": "The party seems particularly keen to associate the term, which dates back to the 19th century, with Nigel Farage Asked to picture a snake-oil salesman, most people would imagine a slimy character with superficial charisma travelling from town to town to hoodwink unsuspecting victims into lapping up all manner of lies.
