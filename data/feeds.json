    "summary": "Questions mount over collapse of trial of teacher and parliamentary researcher accused of spying for China. Dan Sabbagh reports It had all the makings of a pulpy political thriller. For years, British intelligence had been warning about the growing threat of Chinese influence, from political interference to suspected espionage. Then in 2023, two young British men – a parliamentary researcher and a teacher in China – were arrested and accused of spying for China. The headlines were dramatic. But days before the trial was due to begin, the entire case collapsed. Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, was shocked. “I was absolutely gobsmacked,” he tells Nosheen Iqbal.

Without overdoing the blame, say many experts, the chancellor’s tough budget last year and the likelihood of a repeat next month hangs over employers and how they recruit and pay staff. The latest official figures show a rising number of young people out of work in the three months to August. More broadly, unemployment rose to a four-year high and the number of vacancies fell.
