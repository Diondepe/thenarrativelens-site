Fracking is and always has been unpopular, both with people facing it off locally and the wider public. The government must now translate its plans to ban fracking permanently into policy, alongside closing a loophole in planning law that still allows it to happen by the backdoor.

With the historic Liver Building behind him, he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “At the end of it people can agree or disagree, but they can’t say they don’t know what we stand for, what this government is trying to achieve.” Continue reading...",
