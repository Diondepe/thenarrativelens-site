    "summary": "Exclusive: Jihad al-Shamie had been under investigation over alleged sexual attack earlier this year, sources say The Manchester synagogue terrorist was on police bail for an alleged rape when he carried out the attack, the Guardian can reveal. Jihad al-Shamie, 35, was being investigated over an alleged sexual attack, which it is understood was said to have taken place earlier this year. Greater Manchester police said it appeared that armed officers at the synagogue accidentally shot one of the two victims killed during the terrorist attack and that they probably injured another after opening fire on the attacker. Sources disclosed that counter-terrorism police were examining whether Shamie was responsible for a death threat sent to a former Conservative MP in 2012. Keir Starmer called for people to “respect the grief of British Jews” after activists planning to demonstrate against the ban on Palestine Action on Saturday said cancelling the event would “let terror win”. David Lammy, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, was heckled and booed as he addressed a vigil close to the scene of the attack. He faced calls of “shame on you”, “go to Palestine, leave us alone” and “you have blood on your hands”. Police named the two dead men as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Relatives of Cravitz said he was a “gentle giant” who “would never harm a fly”. A Muslim neighbour of Daulby described him as “one of the most fantastic men I ever knew in my life”. Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading a service at the synagogue at the time of the attack, told how the attacker shouted “I’m going to get you” as he tried to force his way in. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Green party leader says a ‘tiny few have taken our wealth and power’ in address to Green party conference. This live blog is closed In his FT interview Mel Stride , the shadow chancellor, also dismissed speculation that Kemi Badenoch will be replaced as Tory leader within the next year. Many of her colleagues think she will face a successful leadership challenge, most probably after poor results in the Senedd, Scottish parliament and English local elections next May. Stride said that he thought Badenoch was similar to Margaret Thatcher, who was widely criticised when she became opposition leader in 1975 but who over time developed into an effective leader. He said: We had all this with Margaret Thatcher back in the 1970s. Her voice wasn’t right, her hair wasn’t right, her dress wasn’t right, she wasn’t very good at prime minister’s questions. It took her some time to work her way into being the finished, formidable politician she was. She is incredibly resilient, as cool as they come. She goes away, thinks about it and comes to a decision. I’m very confident Kemi will be fine. But it’s going to be bumpy — it’s going to be difficult. Labour does not have any plan for growth. They thought that as soon as they got into power, things would just work because they’re Labour and they believe in their own righteousness. That is not working - they need to get a plan to grow our economy, otherwise we will end up going to the IMF cap in hand. A lot of the indicators are pointing in that direction. Many very well respected commentators and economists are saying this. I think that’s very unlikely. That’s not to say we couldn’t be heading for some kind of bond crisis with runaway yields.
